# WebBoardgameSim

This is an online multiplayer board game simulator, which uses django channels to facilitate realtime uptating of board state and realtime chat with chatlogging. Unfortunately I believe that most free web hosting sites wouldn't allow enough cpu cycles/enough control to allow this to run on their servers, so you'll have to host it yourself if you want to see it working.

This is the user homepage which allow the user to see all game rooms they have created and have been invited to.
