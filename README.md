# WebBoardgameSim

This is an online multiplayer board game simulator, which uses django channels to facilitate realtime uptating of board state and realtime chat with chatlogging.

I currently have it hosted on an AWS ec2 instance, so you can play around with the user side stuff [here](http://3.136.86.25:8000/accounts/login/?next=/games/)
